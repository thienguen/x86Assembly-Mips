# 1. Section A & B
I barely passed this class, but meh, still need to keep this around for future courses. There is a lot of stuff we didn't go over as this is a summer course tho.

## 1.1 A. x86Assembly:
### 1.1.1 Assignment 1:
- Learn to assemble, link, and utilize the debugger with a provided program.

An example of basic arithmetic in x86asm, get it to run mean you either done setting up Ubuntu or WSL and the tripple D

### 1.1.2 Assignment 2:
- Write a simple assembly language program to compute the following formulas

Get to study the datetypes in x86asm, remmeber this is important cause the question come back in the test bite you hard with an easy 10 points. What is bits, bytes, words, double, quad, etc.

### 1.1.3 Assignment 3:
- Assembly language arithmetic operations. The assignment went like this datatypes \* arithmetic operations \* 4 for each. 4^3

A lot of typing, it was a big pain peko

### 1.1.4 Assignment 4:
- Write a simple assembly language program to find the minimum, middle value, maximum, sum, and integer average of a list of numbers. Additionally, the program should also find the sum, count, and integer

You probably see stuff like:

1. Sum
2. Min
3. Max
4. Average
5. Median (Middle Value)

### 1.1.5 Assignment 5:
- Write a simple assembly language program to calculate the some geometric information for a series of cubes; areas and volumes

The basic of meth, start doing array calculation and indirection toward a register. Better identify those address, memory, and immidate.

### 1.1.6 Assignment 6:
- Write two macros; one to convert ASCII/binary to decimal and the other to convert decimal to ASCII/binary.

Should have ask the question: "What is the differences between a macro and a function"

### 1.1.7 Assignment 7:
- Write a simple assembly language program to sort a list of signed integer numbers into ascending (small to large) order using bubble sort

If you don't do pseudo code, you r doomed mate. But everything is fine up until now. Doable, maybe

### 1.1.8 Assignment 8:
- Write four simple assembly language functions:
	- 1. `bubblesort()`
	- 2. `impleStats()`, finds the minimum, median, and maximum count of even values, and count of values evenly divisible by 5 for a list of numbers.
	- 3.  `iAvergae()`, computes the integer average for a list of numbers.
	- 4.  `lstStats()`,  to compute the variance and standard deviation for a list of numbers.

Ah, the classic. Should learn stack based arguments and stack dynamic local. Differentiate these cause they technically part of your total grade. Important things should be noted, take note

### 1.1.9 Assignment 9:
 - Write the assembly language functions described

This is when the material start brutlizing. Must understand stack based - related. Anything, everything. Standard Calling Convention popping 

### 1.1.10 Assignment 10:
-  Write a simple assembly language program to plot a series of points on the screen using the provided algorithm.

This is rather an interesting assignment, it deals with floating point arithmetic and a lot of stuff related. All you need to learn is the floating point + function. They do come together, a lot.

### 1.1.11 Assignment 11A & B:
- Just read the pdf file....This worth the most out of all assignment

There is two thing must remember, `getArguments()` and system call -- not how they call, but how they work. 

### 1.1.12 Assignment 12:
 - Write an ASM program that count the mathematicall Perfect nmumber, Abundant number, and Deficient number.

Get the data from main.cpp and develop pseudo code again. Spend some time debuging. It would be a 5 hours assgiment instead of 10

## 1.2 B. Mips:
### 1.2.1 Assignment 1:
 - volumes[n] = aSides[n] ∗ bSides[n] ∗ cSides[n]

Do that, but in mips.

### 1.2.2 Assignment 2:
- Write a couple function in mips:

To be honest, its not that bad since mips syntax are more closer than a high level language tho it's a 32 bits architechture

### 1.2.3 Assignment 3:
- Probably the hardest assignment in mips section, but it's still a 4 hours assignment, probably 5 if you want to optimize and improve the pseudo code

Topic: Multi-Dimension_array

### 1.2.4 Assignment 4:
- Topic: Recursion.

1 hour assignment, get it done with and call it a day. 

Gud luck on your final, gula.
